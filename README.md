# Control_and_Trajectory_Tracking

**Control and Trajectory Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles**
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013

In this project, you apply the skills you have acquired in this course to design a PID controller to perform vehicle trajectory tracking. Given a trajectory as an array of locations, and a simulation environment (the vehicle with possible perturbations), you will design and code a PID controller and test its efficiency on the CARLA simulator used in the industry.
