In this project, you apply the skills you have acquired in this course to design a PID controller to perform vehicle trajectory tracking. Given a trajectory as an array of locations, and a simulation environment (the vehicle with possible perturbations), you design and code a PID controller and test its efficiency on the CARLA simulator used in the industry.

## Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)

## What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?


## How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters? This is an open question, the coherence and justification of the answer is valued. 


## PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller? Find at least 2 pros and cons for model free versus model based.


## (Optional) What would you do to improve the PID controller? This is an open question, the coherence and justification of the answer is valued.
